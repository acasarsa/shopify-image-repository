This app is an image repository code challenge using active storage connected to AWS s3. Due to time constraints and my desire to focus on learning active storage and connecting the app to a cloud service, I opted to make use of a scaffold to quickly set up the basics of this app. 

Posts can be created and deleted. Multiple images can be uploaded at once. The root page is the posts index where you can see all images from every post created. At the top of the page is a list of the existing image albums. 

Click on the new post button to create a new post. Select multiple images to upload at once from the file picker. Click submit to save images to AWS cloud service. 

This was a fun app to build and a good way to learn active storage and AWS.
