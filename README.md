## active storage storing images local
## can upload multiple images at once
## CRUD exists
## can view all images by everyone or check what images are in each album. 

######## ADD #########
## aws connection 
## add ability to view a larger image that is actually a larger pixel not just a spread out version. 
## add users with secure_passwords 
## add login page (might need sessions?? ehhh) so that user can only edit or delete their own posts. 
  ## add user link_to image index thumbnails. 
## alter how edit works. should either display current images and allow you add or remove from that list. 
  ## or you would be able to just delete or add images to the existing post from the show page. 
## add shopping so you can buy images. they would deduct from your money and add to another user's money. image will still appear in users post but it would now say sold instead of having a purchase button...
